# FuckItNode

### JavaScript Runtime Error Steamroller (Now for Node.js)

**Forked from the legendary [FuckItJS](https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs) by Matt Diamond.**  
This version brings all the chaotic energy of the original browser tool to your backend scripts.  
Now you can steamroll your server-side JS like it‚Äôs the early 2000s and nothing matters.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project was vibe-coded with maximum confidence and minimum planning. Use at your own peril. Or don't. We honestly don't care.

## Technology

Through a process known as *Try-It-Explode-It-Nuke-It-And-Retry*, FuckItNode repeatedly attempts to execute your horrific script, slicing out any line that dares throw a runtime error. If a syntax error gets in the way? We steamroll from the bottom of the file up until something vaguely resembling code survives.

Unlike the original, we don‚Äôt rely on jQuery, `onerror`, or the browser. This one‚Äôs pure Node.js, powered by `vm.Script`, `uncaughtException`, and sheer nihilism.

## Usage

```bash
npm install phuckit-node
# npm has a bad word filter üôÉ
```

Just require it using Node's -r flag so it wraps your disaster before it can scream.

```bash
node -r phuckit-node ./your-shitty-script.js
```

Or require it in any file
```js
require('phuckit-node')

// your shitty code
```

### Runtime Compatibility
Node.js 16+. Possibly earlier. Possibly never tested.

Works best on scripts that:
- Were written quickly
- Were never reviewed
- Should never have worked in the first place

### Credit
Massive praise and full credit to Matt Diamond, who birthed this masterpiece of controlled failure known as FuckItJS back in 2012.
This Node version is a spiritual sequel and unholy homage.
